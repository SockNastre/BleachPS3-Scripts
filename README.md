### Information

NOTE: This repo is soon planned to be updated with more scripts of better quality, plus associated batch scripts to run them easier for multiple-file drag and drop. Right now the stuff here is somewhat outdated/unoptimized.

### parse_srtxt
To use this script simply drag and drop .srtxt file onto the script file, it will output a .txt containing the text.
