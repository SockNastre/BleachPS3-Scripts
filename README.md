Requires Python 3

## Information

All batch scripts here run through Python scripts in "pyscripts" folder. The batch script is useful for multiple file dragging and dropping, otherwise the Python scripts can just be used. Currently the texcol_unpack.bat associated python script is being worked on for completion.

If you want to get into contact with anyone involved with these scripts, the best place to get in contact is the [Resurrecci√≥n Toolkit Discord](https://discord.gg/2yfxG6X).
