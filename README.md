Requires Python 3

## Information

All batch scripts here run through Python scripts in "pyscripts" folder. The batch script is useful for multiple file dragging and dropping, otherwise the Python scripts can just be used.

If you want to get into contact with anyone involved with these scripts, the best place to get in contact is the [Resurrección Toolkit Discord](https://discord.gg/2yfxG6X).

### resfat_parse.bat / parse_resfat.py
Drag and drop resFat .bin file onto the script file, it will output (as a text file) the SPK associated with the resFat and also what sections exist within those SPK.

TO DO: Print more general information about the resFat at the beginning of the text file.

### spk_unpack.bat / unpack_spk.py
Drag and drop .spk archives onto the script file, it will unpack the inside contents of the archive. Although many of the times these outputted formats are proprietary and require another tool.
